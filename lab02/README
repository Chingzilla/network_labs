Lab 2

Out-Lab Assignment:
Build a client/server program pair that retrieves movie information using TCP, where the server can handle multiple concurrent connections. The server should use fork to create a child process for each newly-connected client. The server maintains its movie information in a local file movies.txt.

The client program should connect to the server, then when the user inputs a movie title, send that title to the server. The server should return the complete listing of details for that title, or if the input text does not match any title, return "No results found!". The client should output the server's response to the user.

The server must use fork to spawn a process to handle each client, and be able to serve multiple clients simultaneously.
The client must re-use its TCP connection for multiple movie lookups, until the user decides to quit.
Please use port number 55555 for this service.
This assignment is due at the end of next week's lab.

Reading:
Chapters 5.1-5.5 in UNP (Unix Network Programming). I can't emphasize enough how helpful this will be.
